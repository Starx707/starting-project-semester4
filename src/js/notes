------> Ideas

concept changes:
- Remove 2 types of trash
- Make it all potions and sellables
- Still hit other ppl
- Work for Eda the Owl Lady and get stuff she can sell (1.potions 2.human trash 3.scrolls 4.actual trash)
- The more trash the player holds the slower they become

collectable.js
- change collision after for example a button is pressed (fixed to active + gravity)

------> Questions:
- How do I work with layering? Pixel art 

------> To-do:
- deposit function
- enemies
- level itself (just 1 :: collect ....)
- gameover screen
- title screen
- npc's
- player hit
- animations (bonus)


Next steps:
- level design
- put design in game 
- losing life when falling ✅
- losing life when hit something ✅ 
- ground check (for jumping and attacking) ✅
- two types of reactions to hitting something
- game over screen (+restart)
- the goal (1.make goal 2. get notified 3. screen for it) ✅
- enemies walk around (*enemies have idle)
- sprites & looks
- two types of collectables ✅

- animation
- sounds

note to self:
- if variable private then use function to return it and recieve it's value
//Active: can move but can't move through other collisions
//Fixed: can't move but has collision (like platforms)
//Pasive: doesn't do physics but does have collision events (such as for dialog)
//this.body.collisionType = CollisionType.[name]
//this.scene.engine
//this.addChild()

Remove- 
To-do:
- trap [ ] bounce [ ] lose hp (2)
- fall [ ] lose all 3 lives (1)
- ui [ ] just text & despawn everything (3)
- *bounce ball [ ] bounciness for physics (4)

gameover:
- kill everything
- connect to UI and run function to display a game over screen
